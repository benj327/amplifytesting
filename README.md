A basic notes app that I created and edited following the introduction to AWS's Amplify. It includes user authentication for created accounts, a GraphQL database, and Amazon S3 storage for images. Users can create an account, log in, and create notes with a name, description, and attach a file. The user can then sign out and later return to see their notes.
